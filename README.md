<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>My passion for software development began in high school and has evolved into a career path leading me from Front-end to Full-Stack development. I currently build modern web applications using Next.js, TypeScript, and React.js, while expanding my skills in Node.js, Express, and database technologies like MongoDB/PostgreSQL to become a well-rounded Full-Stack developer.</p>
<p>I have a particular interest in cloud technologies. I deploy and manage my projects using Vercel and AWS, actively learning to integrate their solutions to enhance application scalability and performance.</p>
<p>My goal is to create user-friendly interfaces supported by robust backend infrastructure. I'm committed to continuous learning and skill development in this ever-evolving field.</p>
